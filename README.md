> In this study, the free text responses of 387 students of German at 19 Spanish universities were analysed.  The aim was to study the use of strategies related to the discovery of the meaning of new lexical units through natural language processing techniques. For the elaboration of this research, topic modelling techniques, typical in natural language processing, were used. Likewise, being an additional study to a questionnaire that was carried out with the same participants, it was possible to contrast these answers with other closed Likert-type answers. We observe that strategies based on context and the use of other languages, especially English, are among those frequently used in the two studies, while dictionary and social strategies are mentioned at clearly lower levels in the free text. On the other hand, different profiles of strategy use were detected according to students' inclination for certain types of strategies or a combination of several of them.
